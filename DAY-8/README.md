# Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps - HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This is a Python solution for Day 8 of HackerRank's 30 Days of Code challenge. The task is to create a simple phone book using dictionaries and respond to name-based queries. I too learned new things while writing this solution.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given:

- An integer `n` for the number of phone book entries.
- `n` lines of name and phone number pairs.
- Followed by queries (names) to search in the phone book.

For each query, print the name and corresponding number if it exists. If the name is not found, print `Not found`.

## ðŸ“¥ Sample Input
3
sam 99912222
tom 11122222
harry 12299933
3
sam
edward
harry

## ðŸ“¤ Sample Output
sam=99912222
Not found
harry=12299933

## ðŸ“š Concepts Used

- Python Dictionaries (`dict`)
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Input/output handling
