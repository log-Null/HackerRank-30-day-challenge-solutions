# Day 13: Abstract Classes – HackerRank 30 Days of Code

## 📘 Challenge Description

In this challenge, we're working with **abstract classes**.

You're given a base abstract class `Book` with two parameters: `title` and `author`. You must create a subclass called `MyBook` and:

- Initialize the superclass using `title` and `author`
- Add a new parameter `price`
- Implement the `display()` method to print:

```
Title: <title>
Author: <author>
Price: <price>
```

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Abstract classes
- Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Method overriding
- Constructor usage with `super()`

## 🔤 Input Format

You are given three lines of input:
1. `title` – The book's title (string)
2. `author` – The book's author (string)
