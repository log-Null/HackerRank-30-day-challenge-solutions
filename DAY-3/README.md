#  Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements â€“ Python | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

Welcome to **Day 3** of my #30DaysOfCode challenge!  
In this challenge, I solved a conditional logic problem using clean and readable Python â€” demonstrating how control flow handles edge cases and logical structuring.

---

##  Problem Summary

**Objective:**  
Write a program that categorizes a given integer `n` as **"Weird"** or **"Not Weird"** based on the following rules:

| Condition | Output |
|-----------|--------|
| If `n` is odd | Weird |
| If `n` is even and in range `2 to 5` | Not Weird |
| If `n` is even and in range `6 to 20` | Weird |
| If `n` is even and greater than `20` | Not Weird |

##  What I Learned

- Efficient use of `if-elif-else` statements in Python
- Importance of code readability and block structuring
- Using Python best practices like `if __name__ == "__main__"` for modular code
- Clean separation of logic using a custom function
