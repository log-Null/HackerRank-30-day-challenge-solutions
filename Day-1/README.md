#  HackerRank 30 Days of Code: Day 1 – Data Types

This is my solution to  Day 1 challenge from HackerRank’s **30 Days of Code** series.  
The task is to read different types of input data, perform operations, and print the results.

---

##  Problem Description

You are given the following predefined variables:

```python
i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
```

You must:

1. Read:
   - One **integer**
   - One **floating-point number**
   - One **string**
2. Perform and print:
   - Sum of the integer and `i`
   - Sum of the float and `d`
   - Concatenation of `s` and the string

##  Sample Input

```
12
4.0
is the best place to learn and practice coding!
```

## Expected Output

```
16
8.0
HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!
```

---

## 🧾 Explanation

- `i = 4`, `integer = 12` → `4 + 12 = 16`
- `d = 4.0`, `float_num = 4.0` → `4.0 + 4.0 = 8.0`
- `s = 'HackerRank '`, `string = 'is the best...'` → `'HackerRank is the best...'`

Each result is printed on a separate line.

## ▶️ How to Run

Paste the code into any Python environment or save it as `day1_data_types.py`. Then run:

```bash
python day1_data_types.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the inputs one by one.

## 📌 Summary

| Input                            | Output                                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `12`<br>`4.0`<br>`is the best...`| `16`<br>`8.0`<br>`HackerRank is the best...`            |

✅ Challenge complete — you're now confident with Python data types and input/output!
