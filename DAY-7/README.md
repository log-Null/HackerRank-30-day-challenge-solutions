## 📝 Challenge Title
**Day 7: Arrays**

## 🧠 Problem Description

Given an array, print the elements in **reverse order** as a single line of space-separated numbers.

> 📌 **Input:**  
> The first line contains an integer, `n`, the number of elements in the array.  
> The second line contains `n` space-separated integers.

> 📌 **Output:**  
> Print the array elements in reverse order on a single line, separated by spaces.

## ✅ What I Did

- Read input using Python’s `input()` function.
- Stored values in a list and used slicing to reverse it.
- Printed the reversed list using `print()` and `join()`.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Practiced list reversal using Python slice notation (`[::-1]`).
- Refreshed `split()` and `join()` string functions.
- Improved confidence with input handling in coding platforms.
