# Day 17: Exceptions - Calculator Power

## Problem Statement

Create a class `Calculator` with a method `power(n, p)` that takes two integers `n` and `p` and returns `n` raised to the power of `p`.

- If either `n` or `p` is negative, the method should raise an Exception with the message:  
  `"n and p should be non-negative"`

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `T` lines contains two space-separated integers, `n` and `p`.

## Output Format

- For each test case, print the result of `n` raised to the power `p`.
- If an exception occurs, print the exception message.
