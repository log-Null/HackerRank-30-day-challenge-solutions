#  Day 5 - Multiplication Table Generator

This is part of my 30 Days of Python Challenge.  
On Day 5, I created a simple program to generate multiplication tables based on user input.
NOTE ⚠ ❗: I used Python 3

---

##  What I Learned
- Taking integer input from the user
- Using loops (`for`)
- Performing multiplication in a loop
- Printing formatted output in Python 2 using `.format()`

## 🧾 Problem Statement

**Goal:**  
Take an integer input `n` and print the multiplication table of `n` from 0 to `n-1`.
