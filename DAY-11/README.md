# 📅 Day 11: 2D Arrays – HackerRank 30 Days of Code

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a 6x6 2D array of integers, calculate the **maximum hourglass sum**.

An **hourglass** is a subset of values with the following shape in the array:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

There are exactly 16 hourglasses in a 6x6 array.

## 📝 Input Format

- 6 lines of input, each containing 6 space-separated integers.

Example:
```
1 1 1 0 0 0  
0 1 0 0 0 0  
1 1 1 0 0 0  
0 0 2 4 4 0  
0 0 0 2 0 0  
0 0 1 2 4 0  
```

---

## ✅ Output Format

- A single integer: the maximum hourglass sum.

Expected output for the example above:
```
19
```

## 💡 Concepts Used

- 2D Array traversal
- Nested loops
- Subarray pattern recognition
- Math (sum, max)
- Edge case handling with negative values
