# ðŸš€ Day 4: Class vs Instance â€“ HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This  contains the solution for **Day 4: Class vs Instance** from the [30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenge on HackerRank.  
It introduces basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Create a `Person` class with the following features:

- **Constructor `__init__`**: Accepts the person's initial age and validates it.
    - If the age is negative, set it to 0 and print:  
      `Age is not valid, setting age to 0.`
- **Method `amIOld()`**: Prints the age category:
    - If age < 13: `"You are young."`
    - If 13 â‰¤ age < 18: `"You are a teenager."`
    - If age â‰¥ 18: `"You are old."`
- **Method `yearPasses()`**: Increments the person's age by 1.
