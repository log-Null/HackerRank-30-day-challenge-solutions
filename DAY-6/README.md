# Day 6: Let's Review – 30 Days of Code

This challenge is part of the [HackerRank 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) series.

##  Problem Statement

Given a string **S**, you need to:
- Separate the **even-indexed characters** and the **odd-indexed characters** of **S**
- Print them both on the same line, separated by a space

This must be done for **T** number of test cases.
remember we need to take a variable to store how many test cases we are gonna give as input. I made a mistake here while I wrote the code and failed test cases. It was then I realized my mistake and rewrote the code. Always read tasks carefully
